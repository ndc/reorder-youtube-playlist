# Feature Specification: Reorder YouTube Playlists

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-small`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a small web app to reorder videos in YouTube public and private playlists (up to 500 videos). Provide drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts, and direct position entry. Support multi-sort by channel, duration, date added to playlist, date uploaded, and title."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
	- User types and permissions
	- Data retention/deletion policies  
	- Performance targets and scale
	- Error handling behaviors
	- Integration requirements
	- Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a playlist owner, I want to quickly reorder videos in my public and private YouTube playlists (up to 500 items) using drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts, or direct position input, so that I can arrange content the way I prefer without cumbersome manual steps.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a playlist with 200 videos, When the user opens it, Then the system displays all items with essential metadata (title, channel, duration, date added to playlist, date uploaded) and enables reordering controls.
2. Given a playlist with 50 videos, When the user drags one video above another, Then the preview order updates immediately without committing changes until the user confirms Apply/Save.
3. Given a playlist with 300 videos, When the user uses keyboard shortcuts to move the selected video up/down and jump to a specific position they enter, Then the preview order updates accordingly and remains fully keyboard-operable.
4. Given a playlist with mixed channels, When the user applies a multi-sort (primary: channel A‚ÜíZ, secondary: title A‚ÜíZ), Then the preview shows a stable ordering grouped by channel with alphabetical titles within each channel.
5. Given a playlist with 500 videos, When the user chooses to sort by duration (shortest‚Üílongest), Then the preview reflects the ordering within reasonable time for the full list and the user can Apply to commit.
6. Given a user with access to a private playlist they own, When they open it, Then they can reorder it with the same capabilities as a public playlist they own.

### Edge Cases
- Playlist has 0 or 1 item (no-op reordering).
- Exactly 500 items (upper limit): still fully supported.
- Items with missing or unknown metadata (e.g., unknown duration) must be handled consistently in sorting.
- Duplicate titles or identical sort keys: stable ordering and deterministic tie-breakers.
- Unavailable items (deleted/private/unplayable) appear in list: user can still position them; system communicates any constraints.
- Concurrency: items added/removed/changed while user is editing; user is informed and can refresh or reconcile before Apply.
- Navigation away with unsaved changes triggers a confirmation prompt.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow the user to select one of their playlists to reorder.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST support reordering for playlists the user owns that are public or private.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST display up to 500 items from the selected playlist including: title, channel, duration, date added to playlist, and date uploaded (when available).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow rearranging items via drag-and-drop on the list.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST allow keyboard-only operation for reordering, including moving selection, moving an item up/down, and jumping an item to a specified position.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST allow the user to directly specify a target position (e.g., "move to position N") for the selected item.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST support multi-sort with user-defined precedence and direction across: channel, duration, date added to playlist, date uploaded, and title.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST present a preview of the new order before committing changes; no changes are persisted until the user confirms Apply/Save.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST commit the final order to the playlist and clearly confirm success or report any failures.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST handle missing metadata fields during sort (e.g., unknown duration) using a documented fallback and tie-breaking rule.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST provide deterministic tie-breaking when sort keys are equal (e.g., preserve original relative order unless otherwise specified).
- **FR-012**: The system MUST be fully usable with keyboard only, including discovery of available commands and focus management for long lists.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST warn the user about unsaved changes when navigating away or closing the app.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST inform the user if the playlist changes externally during editing and provide a way to refresh.
- **FR-015**: The system SHOULD provide clear status and progress when loading large playlists (e.g., 500 items).
- **FR-018**: The system MUST provide clear error messages for permission issues, quota/limit issues, and transient errors, guiding the user to retry or adjust scope.
- **FR-019**: The system MUST default string sorting (title, channel) to a consistent collation and case handling.
- **FR-020**: The system MUST allow the user to choose ascending/descending per sort field and define the precedence of multiple fields.

### Key Entities (data involved)
- **User**: The playlist owner interacting with the system; has permission to view and reorder their playlists.
- **Playlist**: A named collection of up to 500 items the user owns; attributes include name, privacy status, item count.
- **Playlist Item (Video)**: An item with attributes needed for sorting and display: title, channel, duration, date added to playlist, date uploaded, and an identifier to reference its position in the playlist.
- **Sort Rule**: A user-defined instruction: field (channel/duration/date added/date uploaded/title), direction (asc/desc), precedence.
- **Reorder Plan**: The calculated target order based on user actions (manual moves, position entries) and/or multi-sort; includes preview and ability to apply.
- **Operation Result**: Outcome of applying the reorder (success, partial success with conflicts, failure) and any messages shown to the user.

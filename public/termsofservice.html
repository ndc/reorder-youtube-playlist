                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                <p class="muted">Last updated: October 16, 2025</p>

                <p>
                    Welcome to <strong>Reorder Playlist</strong> (the “App”). These Terms of Service
                    ("Terms") explain how you can use the App and what you can expect from us. By
                    using the App, you agree to these Terms. Please read them before continuing.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
                <p>
                    Reorder Playlist is owned and operated individually by Endy Tjahjono ("we",
                    "us", or "our"). If you have questions, email us at
                    <a href="mailto:reorder-playlist@googlegroups.com"
                        >reorder-playlist@googlegroups.com</a
                    >.
                </p>

                <h2>2. What the App does</h2>
                <p>
                    Reorder Playlist helps you reorganize your YouTube playlists more efficiently.
                    You can use keyboard shortcuts or automatic sorting options to move items around
                    in your playlists — a faster alternative to manually dragging and dropping items
                    on YouTube.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Using the App</h2>
                <p>
                    You do not need to create a separate account to use Reorder Playlist. To
                    interact with your YouTube playlists, you will need to sign in with your YouTube
                    account (Google). This authentication happens through YouTube's official API. We
                    do not store your login credentials or collect personal data.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Your content</h2>
                <p>
                    Your YouTube playlists and their contents remain yours. Reorder Playlist only
                    accesses them temporarily via the YouTube API to help you rearrange items. We do
                    not copy, modify, or share your playlists outside your YouTube account.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
                <p>
                    The App relies on the YouTube API to function. By using Reorder Playlist, you
                    also agree to YouTube's and Google's terms and policies. If YouTube changes its
                    API or policies, it may affect how the App works.
                </p>

                <h2>6. No fees</h2>
                <p>Reorder Playlist is free to use. There are no paid features or subscriptions.</p>

                <h2>7. Acceptable use</h2>
                <p>
                    Please use the App responsibly. Examples of misuse include (but are not limited
                    to):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trying to interfere with how the App or the YouTube API works;</li>
                    <li>Using someone else's YouTube account without their permission;</li>
                    <li>
                        Attempting to reverse engineer, exploit, or scrape the App in unintended
                        ways.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may restrict or block access if you violate these Terms.</p>

                <h2>8. Disclaimer and limitation of liability</h2>
                <p>
                    The App is provided <strong>"as is"</strong> and
                    <strong>"as available"</strong>. We aim to keep it running smoothly, but we
                    cannot promise it will always be error-free or available. We are not responsible
                    for any loss or damage resulting from your use of (or inability to use) the App,
                    including any impact on your YouTube account or playlists.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Indemnity</h2>
                <p>
                    You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Endy Tjahjono from any claims, losses,
                    liabilities, damages, and expenses arising out of your use of the App or your
                    breach of these Terms.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Suspension and termination</h2>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the App if you violate
                    these Terms or for any other reason at our discretion.
                </p>

                <h2>11. Changes to these Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we'll post the revised
                    version here with a new "Last updated" date.
                </p>

                <h2>12. Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    You can find our Privacy Policy here:
                    <a href="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>13. YouTube API disclosure</h2>
                <p>
                    Reorder Playlist uses YouTube API Services to access and modify your playlists.
                    By using the App, you consent to the App accessing your YouTube data via
                    Google's OAuth process and agree to Google's
                    <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> and
                    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not
                    store your Google account password, and we only request the minimum permissions
                    needed to reorder your playlists.
                </p>
